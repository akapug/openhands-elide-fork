# Elide PKL manifests (placeholder)

This folder will hold Pkl configuration/manifests for the Elide runtime sandbox and project overlays.

Notes:
- Built-in module path typically amends "elide:project.pkl" (case-sensitive on Linux CI).
- After Pkl changes, ensure generated resources are available on classpath (see elide-repo rules).
